The [culturing protocol](https://github.com/platynereis/resources/blob/main/Fischer-Dorrenstejn_Culture_Instructions.txt) developed by Albrecht Fischer and Adriaan Dorresteijn many years ago is still the basis of each *Platynereis* culture. Over the years, it has been perfected and adapted to the needs of each lab. 


## Further developments and improvements

The [Özplot lab](labs.md#özplot-lab) developed a scaleable and movable culturing system, which is especially advantagous for small lab space [(Kuehn et al. 2019)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0226156). Furthermore, the standardized feeding method guaranteed robust and comparable conditions.
