# Synopsis

_Platynereis dumerilii_ is a marine annelid that lives in shallow waters around the globe [[citation needed]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed). It is one of the coolest emerging model organisms around, for the following reasons (in no particular order):

* Very easy to keep and breed in the lab - people have been doing it since the late 19th century.
* Transparent, especially in early stages, greatly facilitating microscopy.
* Important ecological role as bottom feeder.
* Slowly evolving species with conserved ancestral characteristics.
* Highly stereotypical, synchronous development, at least until 6dpf.
* Lots of cell types, while still being small enough that we can study them all.
* Lots of polymorphism on the sequence level.
* For sure cooler than _C. elegans_.
* Rich behaviour with mixed benthic/pelagic lifestyle.
* Lifelong segment proliferation.
* Can regenerate without being creepy (looking at you, planarians).

Contrary to rumours, the 6dpf stage (late nectochaete) is not cursed.
